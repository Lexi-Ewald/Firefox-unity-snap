# How to report a security issue with the firefox snap

The easiest way to report a security issue is through [GitHub](https://github.com/ubuntu/app-center/security/advisories/new).
See [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy)
contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.

If you believe the issue is an upstream one you might also want to check
the Mozilla [policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/)
